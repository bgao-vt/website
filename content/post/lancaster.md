I will be visiting Lancaster University, UK from Oct. 2018 to Jul. 2019, for the partnership between BJTU and LU. In the following years, I will teach two modules "Artificial Intelligence" and "Embedded Systems" (expected) at the Lancaster University College, a joint institute located at our Weihai campus.
