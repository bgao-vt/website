abstract = "This paper presents a suboptimal approach for resource allocation of massive MIMO-OFDMA systems for high-speed train (HST) applications. An optimization problem is formulated to alleviate the severe Doppler effect and maximize the energy efficiency (EE) of the system. We propose to decouple the problem between the allocations of antennas, subcarriers, and transmit powers and solve the problem by carrying out the allocations separately and iteratively in an alternating manner. Fast convergence can be achieved for the proposed approach within only several iterations. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm is superior to existing techniques in terms of system EE and throughput in different system configurations of HST applications."
